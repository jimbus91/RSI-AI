This script is using the yfinance library to download historical stock data for a given ticker symbol, and then using that data to create a machine learning model using the HistGradientBoostingRegressor class from scikit-learn. The script then use the model to make predictions for the next 30 days, and plots the predictions with the historical data. Additionally, it calculates the relative strength index (RSI) for the last year and the next 30 days and add some random noise to the predictions to make them more realistic. Finally, it concatenates the historical data and the predictions and then saves the result in predictions_df variable.
